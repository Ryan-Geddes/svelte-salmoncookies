### Pros

1. Svelte converts your app into ideal JavaScript at build time, rather than interpreting your application code at run time.
2. No performance cost of the framework's abstractions.
3. You can build your entire app with Svelte, or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase.
4. Svelte is a compiler that knows at build time how things could change in your app, rather than waiting to do the work at run time.
